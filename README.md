which demonstrates a simple video being played over a surface. The size of the
video can be controlled through the layout parameters (set to stretch to the
full device area), but the surface fixed size is set to 20x10. Why does the
content not get pixelated? Is setFixedSize() being ignored? Why is it useful
then?
